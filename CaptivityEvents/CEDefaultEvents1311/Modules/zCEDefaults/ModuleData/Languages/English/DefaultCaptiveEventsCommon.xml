    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsCommon141" text="Returning from an apparently successful raid, your captors have managed to procure a set of mugs and a keg of strong mead. They decide to make their hideout a bit classier by putting you to work as their servant, and order you to keep their cups full as they drink the night away. Judging by their demeanor and the treatment you've seen of waiters in even the most reputable of taverns, you fear this might not end well for you, but they insist that if you object, they'll have fun beating you into submission instead." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsCommon142" text="Do your best." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsCommon143" text="Refuse and accept their punishment." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsCommon144" text="Your captors grow bored, and without much luck scavenging for new prisoners or supplies, they decide to have fun inventing new ways to torment you. They drag you to a small lake, then bind your legs together throw the other end of the rope over the overhanging branch of a nearby tree. Too late, you realize their intention and fall to the ground as they begin hoisting you up by your legs. You writhe helplessly as they take turns dunking your head in and out of the water, laughing as you cough and gasp, desperately trying to catch your breath. They eventually lose interest, dropping you entirely into the pool, and you struggle to swim with your hands bound for a few minutes before one of them pulls your soaking body to shore." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsCommon145" text="Slip from your bindings." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsCommon146" text="It takes an unbelievable amount of effort, but you eventually manage to slip free; your struggles and the cold water used to torture you have loosened your bonds. You leap back into the water and swim as fast as you can to escape, gambling that none of them will know how to swim or be inclined to follow, and sure enough there is nothing but blissful silence to meet you on the opposite shore. You take a moment to catch your breath, grateful that your captors weren't able to follow..." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsCommon147" text="Your captors decide to play at being knights, harnessing a confused-looking mule with makeshift barding, and climb atop it. One of them procures a blunted lance, and they build a set of makeshift targets out of straw bales. After a few tries, they realize they're going to need someone to hold their targets in place, and order you to perform the dubious task. Judging by their past performance, you fear they're just as likely to hit you as the target..." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsCommon148" text="Hope they don't miss." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsCommon149" text="A few agonizing hours later, you revise your opinion; they were much more likely to hit you than the target, leading you to believe this was perhaps their goal in the first place. You're thankful at least that the mule was not particularly fast, nor well trained, or you fear you would not have survived this exercise. Though you are badly bruised from a goodly number of playful stabs with the blunted lance, your captors seem quite cheerful as they lead you back to camp." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsCommon150" text="Tend to your bruises." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsCommon151" text="Angered by your defiance, your captors beat you soundly, leaving your skin tender and bruised. After watching another of the captives play along with their sadistic game, however, you're certain you made the right choice; by the time they grow bored of the novelty, there's hardly a spot visible on the poor man's skin that isn't a vivid shade of black or blue." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsCommon152" text="That was a close call." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsCommon153" text="Your captors decide to tie your hands together and parade you around camp atop a hog they've captured, jeering and comparing you unfavorably to the poor creature. It seems frightened at the commotion, and begins squealing and kicking to try to buck you off. You're not particularly keen to get stabbed by one of its cloven hooves if you fall off..." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsCommon154" text="Try to hold on." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsCommon155" text="You kick at the the hog's sides, urging it forward, but it doesn't seem to understand your intent." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsCommon156" text="Continue your ride." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsCommon157" text="You kick the hog's sides, urging it forward, and it sets off with a burst of frenzied speed. Your captor yells in pain as the creature rips the lead from {?ISCAPTORFEMALE}her{?}his{\?} hand, and you go shooting directly through the camp, exiting out the other side at full gallop. Your captors make a half-hearted attempt to catch you, but they're laughing so hard they can't keep up. After a few minutes' brisk ride, the hog stops, sniffing around, and begins digging in the dirt, searching for something to eat." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsCommon158" text="Thank your noble steed for the rescue." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsCommon159" text="Your captor indicates they've sold you to a local tavern for a day, and expect you to work your hardest to earn your keep. They make it clear you will be punished should the tavern's owner not be satisfied. The customers soon realize you're not there of your free will and take great pleasure in tormenting their you, pelting you with shells and insults as they find increasingly degrading ways to call for your service." />

They make it clear you will be punished should the tavern's owner not be satisfied. Your heart sinks as you are taken to a pile of filthy mugs and plates stacked from floor to ceiling. The tavern's owner seems sheepish about asking you to handle the task on your own, but it quickly becomes obvious they have no time to help as the sound of rowdy customers filters through to the kitchens. At least you're not being forced to work out there..." />

    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsCommon163" text="As the sun grows low in the sky, you finally see the bottom of the pile. On either side of the kitchen are stacks of neatly-cleaned dishes and sparkling mugs, but they seem to have transferred their filth to the rags you wear. Your fingers are raw from the scrubbing, and the muscles in your arms mutinously protest your ordeal. The tavern's owner returns and seems awed by the sight. He offers you a meal of actual meat and bread before your owner arrives, the first decent food you've had since your captivity started." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsCommon164" text="Sate your growling stomach." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsCommon165" text="Behind one of the piles of dishes you spot a locked door, and from the smell of sun-baked manure you guess it leads outside. Putting your whole body's weight behind your shoulder you smash it open, falling to the ground as the door is torn off its hinges, and find it leads to the nearby stables. Quickly saddling a confused-looking horse, you ride to freedom before anyone can come to investigate the noise." />

They make it clear you will be severely punished should the tavern's owner not be satisfied. You are ordered to stand out front and invite new patrons inside, a heavy sign locked around your neck to make escape impossible. The place is filthy and unkempt, so it's not difficult to see why it's having trouble attracting customers, and the inn's owner seems dour and unfriendly. Your captor is likely to be unhappy with the day's work no matter how hard you try..." />

    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsCommon170" text="The customers are surprisingly civil, and you almost begin to enjoy the work as they thank you and smile after each delivery. A few patrons get rowdy but are quickly escorted to the door, and though your shift is long and the work unceasing, for the first time in weeks you feel like you're being treated like a person instead of a prisoner.
