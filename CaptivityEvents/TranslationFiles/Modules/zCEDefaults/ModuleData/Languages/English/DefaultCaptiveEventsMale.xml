    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsMale1" text="Your captor invites you to her tent and you follow, cautiously. You find her sitting on her bed, her dress hiked up over her legs, rubbing her pussy with one hand and holding a bottle of wine in her other. You start to realize why you are here and turn to leave, but it seems the guards have moved into place behind you; though they're facing the other direction, you get the distinct impression they will not look favorably upon any attempts to escape." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsMale2" text="Kneel down and crawl over to her." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsMale3" text="Attack her!" />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsMale4" text="Your captor smiles as you approach, spreading her legs invitingly, but as you get closer she grabs you painfully by the hair and pours half the bottle of wine down your throat. As you gasp for air, she orders you to swallow and the burning liquid fills your stomach. As your head begins to spin, she guides your mouth to her cleft and orders you to pleasure her." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsMale5" text="Try to dry yourself off." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsMale6" text="You do your best to satisfy her with your tongue, and are rewarded with a crushing sensation around your neck as she uses her legs to pull your face tighter into her cunt. You struggle to breathe as she rubs your lips against her clit, arching and bucking against you. When she finally comes, your mouth is flooded with her sweet-tasting fluid. She tells you she'll have you again soon. The guards outside chuckle lightly as you leave, your face still drenched in her wetness." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsMale7" text="Your captor insults you viciously, telling you he's heard you're nothing but a contemptible sneak. Something in his manner tells you this is all a game to him..." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsMale8" text="Too bad no one's ever heard of YOU at all." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsMale9" text="I'd be in real trouble if you ever used them." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsMale10" text="I wanted to make sure you'd feel comfortable with me." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsMale11" text="Your captor insults you, telling you there are no words for how disgusting you are. Something in his manner tells you this is all a game to him..." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsMale12" text="Your hemorrhoids are flaring up again eh?" />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsMale13" text="Yes there are. You just never learned them." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsMale14" text="Your captor insults you, telling you that you fight like a dairy farmer. Something in his manner tells you this is all a game to him..." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsMale15" text="You run THAT fast?" />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsMale16" text="Why? Did you want to borrow one?" />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsMale17" text="How appropriate! You fight like a cow!" />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsMale18" text="Your captor smiles grudgingly then makes a note of your response and waves you away, apparently content." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsMale19" text="Return to your place." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsMale20" text="Attempt to escape." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsMale21" text="Your captor rolls his eyes disdainfully, bemoaning that he has no enemies smart enough to begin to challenge his rapier wit, and orders his guards to punish you, telling you he hopes your suffering will improve your appreciation for the value of wordplay." />
    <string id="DefaultCaptiveEventsMale22" text="What is he talking about?" />
